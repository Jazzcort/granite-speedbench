The Lantern Keeper’s Secret

The village of Lornhollow sat quietly at the edge of a mist-shrouded forest, nestled between jagged hills and long-forgotten ruins. Its crooked lanes and thatched roofs had changed little in centuries. To outsiders, Lornhollow was ordinary—sleepy, humble, perhaps even dull. But to those who lived there, the village carried an old, unspoken truth: never ask about the light at the top of the cliff.

It was always there—flickering gently from dusk until dawn—a golden flame that shimmered like a lighthouse, although there were no ships, no sea. Children would ask, as they always do, why a lantern would burn so far above the town. Parents would offer a quick smile, a vague answer, and a reminder to stay away from the cliffside after dark.

But some stories are too heavy to stay buried forever.
I. The Curious Apprentice

Seventeen-year-old Elia Wren had never been one to accept silence as an answer. Daughter of the village blacksmith, she had grown up strong, inquisitive, and a little too bold for her own good. She’d always been drawn to the strange rhythm of the light above the cliff—how it pulsed sometimes in rapid bursts, other times slow and steady, like a heartbeat. No one else ever talked about the pattern. No one else seemed to notice it changed.

When Elia mentioned it once to her mother, the woman had gone pale and changed the subject. Her father had only mumbled, “That’s just the Lantern Keeper’s way.”

The Lantern Keeper. That was what they called the old man who lived in the stone tower atop the cliff. No one remembered his name, or how long he had lived there. He was part of the landscape, like the trees or the rocks. And no one had seen him up close in decades.

But Elia had made up her mind.

She packed her satchel the night before the winter solstice, when the mist rolled in thick and low, and climbed the winding path toward the tower just after sunset. The sky had turned lavender and indigo. The light atop the cliff burned bright and steady.

She brought bread, a flask of water, a lantern of her own—and her courage.
II. The Tower Above

The trail was older than she expected. Overgrown with vines and moss, the stones beneath her feet were slick with mist. But the deeper she climbed, the more she could feel it—that strange pull, as if something ancient was calling her forward. Her heartbeat quickened. She passed gnarled trees, stones carved with symbols, and once, a rusted gate hanging broken from its hinges.

The tower emerged from the fog like a ghost—tall, narrow, made of black stone that gleamed slightly under the moonlight. At its top, the great lantern flame swayed gently, its glow spilling out across the mist like liquid gold.

Elia approached the heavy wooden door and knocked.

There was no answer.

She knocked again, louder this time.

And then, the door creaked open.

The man standing before her was impossibly old. His beard hung to his waist like white threads of cobweb, and his eyes glowed with a golden hue, almost like the lantern itself. He didn’t look surprised to see her.

“You’ve come early,” he said, voice low and raspy.

“I… I want to know about the lantern,” Elia said. “Why it burns. Why no one talks about it.”

The man studied her for a long moment. Then he stepped aside.

“You’d better come in, then.”
III. A Flame Beyond Fire

Inside, the tower was warm. Strange, Elia thought, considering there was no fire she could see. The walls were lined with books, scrolls, maps. Shelves held glass bottles that glowed faintly in different colors—some pulsed, others hummed quietly. In the center of the room, a spiral staircase led upward into darkness.
